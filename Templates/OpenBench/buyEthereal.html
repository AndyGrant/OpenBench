            <h1> Ethereal 14.00 </h1>

            <hr>

            <p> Ethereal 14.00 (NNUE) has been released, marking a significant improvement in playing strength, which can be seen in events like TCEC, CCC, and soon to be seen in many rating lists like CCRL, CEGT, SPCC, and FastGM. With this release, Ethereal once again solidifies itself as the leader of the pack of rapidly rising and innovating engines vying to break into the top 3 to join Stockfish, Leela, and Komodo. </p>

            <p> This most recent version has been a massive undertaking. In the process of data generation for the Standard NNUEs, a total of 1.456 billion games were played, ranging from low depth games, to extremely  high node counts. For the Fischer Random NNUEs, an additional 600 million games were played. The results of these efforts are significantly larger, and more powerful NNUEs, with the ability to perform well with an increasingly diverse set of positions.</p>

            <p> Ethereal's NNUE release marked the first time an engine offered a secondary Network trained exclusively for Fischer Random Chess (FRC). Later versions also marked the first use of mirrored-halfkx NNUEs, now a de facto standard. Ethereal 14.00 continues that tradition with a new FRC network once again, granting immense gains over the Standard Network, helping Ethereal to create new theory where there is none. </p>

            <hr>

            <p> With all of these advances, Ethereal has put up incredible accomplishments since the most recent release... </p>
