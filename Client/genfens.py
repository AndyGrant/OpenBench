# The main purpose of this module is to invoke create_genfens_opening_book().
# Refer to Client/worker.py, or Scripts/genfens_engine.py for the arguments.
#
# We will execute engines with commands like the following:
#   ./engine "genfens N seed S book <None|Books/book.epd> <?extra>" "quit"
#
# This work is split over many engines. If a workload requires 1024 openings,
# and there are 16 threads, then each thread will generate 64 openings.
#
# create_genfens_opening_book() may raise utils.OpenBenchFailedGenfensException.
# This occurs when longer than 15 seconds has elapsed since getting an opening.
# This should only occur if one or more of the engine processes has stalled.
