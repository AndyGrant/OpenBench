# OpenBench

OpenBench is an open-source Chess Engine Testing Framework for UCI engines. OpenBench provides a lightweight interface and client to facilitate running fixed-game tests as well as SPRT tests to benchmark changes to engines for performance and stability. OpenBench supports [Fischer Random Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960).

OpenBench is the primary testing framework used for the development of [Ethereal.](https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal) The primary instance of OpenBench can be found at [http://chess.grantnet.us](http://chess.grantnet.us/). The Primary instance of OpenBench supports development for
[Berserk](https://github.com/jhonnold/berserk), [Bit-Genie](https://github.com/Aryan1508/Bit-Genie), [BlackMarlin](https://github.com/dsekercioglu/blackmarlin), [Demolito](https://github.com/lucasart/Demolito), [Drofa](https://github.com/justNo4b/Drofa), [Ethereal](https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal), [FabChess](https://github.com/fabianvdW/FabChess), [Halogen](https://github.com/KierenP/Halogen), [Igel](https://github.com/vshcherbyna/igel), [Koivisto](https://github.com/Luecx/Koivisto), [Laser](https://github.com/jeffreyan11/laser-chess-engine), [RubiChess](https://github.com/Matthies/RubiChess), [Seer](https://github.com/connormcmonigle/seer-nnue), [Stash](https://github.com/mhouppin/stash-bot), [Weiss](https://github.com/TerjeKir/weiss), [Winter](https://github.com/rosenthj/Winter), and [Zahak](https://github.com/amanjpro/zahak). A dozen or more engines are using their own private, local instances of OpenBench.
